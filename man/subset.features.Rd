keep.features(mD, features)

drop.features(mD, features)

filter.features(mD, ...)

remove.eukarya(mD)
}
\arguments{
\item{mD}{required; the microbData object to be updated.}

\item{features}{character or logical; a vector of feature names to keep or drop. Also can be a logical vector that is either named or in the exact same order as those in the Feature Names slot.}

\item{...}{logical expression(s) by which to filter features based on the Features table, e.g. `Kingdom == "Bacteria" & Family != "Mitochondria"`.}

Create a new microbData objects with just the specified features

Create a new microbData objects without the specified features

Create a new microbData objects with features that match the filter
